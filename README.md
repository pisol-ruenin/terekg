# TeReKG: Embedding Temporal Collaborative Graphs for Software Team Recommendation

## Experiment
This research apply the knowledge graph to represent the software developement data. The processes start from knoweledge graph construction, comparison between embedding models, single role recommendation, and team recommendaiton as following source code.
1. [Knowledge Graph Construction](https://github.com/pisol-ruenin/terekg/tree/main/network-generation "Knowledge Graph Construction")
2. [Knowledge Embedding Model Comparison](https://github.com/pisol-ruenin/terekg/tree/main/model-selection "Knowledge Embedding Model Comparison")
3. [Single Role Recommendation](https://github.com/pisol-ruenin/terekg/tree/main/single-role-recommendation "Single Role Recommendation")
4. [Team Recommendation](https://github.com/pisol-ruenin/terekg/tree/main/team-recommendation "Team Recommendation")
