# TeReKG: Embedding Temporal Collaborative Graphs for Software Team Recommendation

## Experiment
This research applies the knowledge graph to represent the software development data. The processes start from knowledge graph construction, comparison between embedding models, single role recommendation, and team recommendations as following source code.
1. [Knowledge Graph Construction](https://github.com/pisol-ruenin/terekg/tree/main/network-generation "Knowledge Graph Construction")
2. [Knowledge Embedding Model Comparison](https://github.com/pisol-ruenin/terekg/tree/main/model-selection "Knowledge Embedding Model Comparison")
3. [Single Role Recommendation](https://github.com/pisol-ruenin/terekg/tree/main/single-role-recommendation "Single Role Recommendation")
4. [Team Recommendation](https://github.com/pisol-ruenin/terekg/tree/main/team-recommendation "Team Recommendation")

## Support
If you have any issues with the source code or prefer the constructed data/knowledge graph, please do not hesitate to create an issue on this repository. We will resolve your request.
